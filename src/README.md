Welcome to EP for Foals, a guide to get onboard EPs, written by Team Cloudchaser. The guide tries to cover the basic aspect of EP (encapsulated proxy) setup and use.

The guide is so easy, even foals will understand!

Before begin going through the guide, it's recommended to read the [foreword](./0/0.md) first, to grasp who this guide is for, and what purpose does this guide serve.
